General Assembly WDI January 22 - Project 2

- Project: 
- Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/ewnKaU0M/beat-sales
- GitHub: https://github.com/chadchristensen/beats_app

## Overview
The goal of this project was to apply our knowledge of the MVC framework using Ruby on Rails to create a CRUD application with AuthN and AuthZ. I chose to integrate my love of music and to create a site where producers can upload their tracks and users can listen and favorite the tracks.
